This is a fork of repository https://salsa.debian.org/debian/avrdude.git which is maintained by @milan-kupcevic for @Debian.

The purpose of this repo is to combine up-to-date source with custom modifications and not-yet-accepted patches.

Since AVRDUDE project is using SVN version control, it is little inconvenient to experiment with it. Hopefully with
time the local changes can be merged back in upstream project.


For more info see other README files in this repository.
